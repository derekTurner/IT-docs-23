# Using React for client side applications

React is a javaScript framework which is normally used to generate client side User Interfaces for web apps.  That is how it will be used here,but be aware that React could also be used on the server side.


At the time of writing the current version of React is 18.2.0.  There is a lot of reference material on React in the form of tutorials and blogs available online.  Take care in interpreting this to ensure that you use material compatible with version 18 and following modern coding approaches.
